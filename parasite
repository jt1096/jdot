00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,830
Young and simple.
年輕，而且單純

147
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,414
Simple?
單純？

148
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,999
What do you mean?
什麼意思？

149
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:49,629
Anyway, it's all good. I had fun there.
說不上來，總之我挺喜歡的

150

So you agree? I guess so.

Hey, you said your sister is artistic?
聽說你妹不是很有藝術天分？

152
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,398
Good at Photoshop?
（在學證明） -修圖技術也很強

153
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:06,187
God, with skills like this, why can't you get into art school?
（延世大學） 技術這麼好，竟然考不上美術系？

154
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,539
Shut up.
找死嗎？

155
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,318
Hey, no smoking in here.
小姐，這裡禁菸

156
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,778
Yeah, yeah. Gimme that.
好，把那個拿給我

157
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,914
Yeah.
好

158
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,925
Now the cherry on top...
紅色印章，大功告成

159
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:28,251
Wow, does Oxford have a major in document forgery?
真可惜首爾大學沒有「偽造文書」系

160
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,671
Ki-jung would be top of her class.
基婷一定考榜首

161
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:40,388
She's amazing, huh? Our boy's going for a job interview. Wish him luck.

I don't think of this as forgery or crime.

00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,067
I'll go to this university next year.
我明年就會考上這間名校

167
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,779
So you've got a plan!
原來你都計畫好了

168
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,338
I just printed out the document a bit early.
我只是提前拿到在學證明而已

169
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,612
Who is it?
請問哪位？

170
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,739

The yard is so nice. The inside's nice too.

178
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,458
You know the architect Namgoong? He's famous.
你知道建築家南宮賢子老師嗎？ 他很有名

179
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:36,016
He used to live in this house.
這原本是他的房子

180
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,433
He designed it himself.
全都由他親自設計和監工

181
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,724
As you can see, now it's a playpen.
現在如你所見，是孩子的遊樂園

182
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,110
This way.
這邊請

183
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:58,040
Sit yourself down here. I'll bring the madame. Yes.
先坐著等一下，我請太太過來 是

184
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,063

（南韓企業攻佔紐約）

185
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,160

（2017年新興技術獎）

186
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,341
Madame.
太太

187
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,548
Madame?
太太？

188
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,385
Madame?
太太？

189
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,638
Madame?
太太？

190
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:25,485
He's here. The tutoring candidate.
應徵家教老師的人來了

191
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,974
I don't care about documents.
不用給我看資料

192
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,269
Min recommended you, after all.
反正是敏赫老師介紹的

193
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:39,901
As you know, Min is such a brilliant human being.
你也知道敏赫老師無可挑剔

194
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,236
Da-hye and I were quite happy with him.
我和多蕙對他很滿意

195
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,573
Regardless of her grades. Know what I mean?
這跟多蕙的成績無關 你懂我的意思嗎？

196
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,033
Yes.
是

197
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:56,793
He was marvelous. So to be honest, we wanted to stick with him through high school.
他真的很棒 說實話，本來打算到明年學測前 都要一直請敏赫老師來家教的

198
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:01,681
But all of a sudden he's going abroad.
不過他卻突然去留學

199
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:07,762
Anyway, excuse me, but if I can speak directly,
雖然有點失禮，但我就直說了

200
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:16,896
if you're not up to Min's level, then, I'm not sure what the point is.
如果你不是敏赫老師的等級 我們坐在這裡就沒有意義了

201
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:21,025
So anyway, what I want to say is,
其實我想說的是…

202
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:26,739
for your first lesson today, do you mind if I sit in?
我可以觀摩今天的第一堂課嗎？

203
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:32,378
I want to see it full time, how you run your lesson.
我想全程觀察你怎麼授課

204
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,594
Is it okay with you?
可以嗎？

205
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,999
You sure about #24?
你想改24題的答案嗎？

206
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:17,498
Da-hye, you solved those later problems then went back to #24.
多蕙，你寫了後面的題目 然後又回到24題

207
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,884
Right?
對吧？

208
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,762
Yes.
是

209
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:35,600
If that were the first question on a real exam, you'd be screwed.
如果現在是學測，這是第一題的話 你從一開始就亂了陣腳

210
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,784
Look at this. Your pulse is racing.
你看，脈搏也亂了

211
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:45,915
The heart doesn't lie.
心跳不會說謊

212
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,572
An exam is like slashing through a jungle.
所謂考試就是衝鋒陷陣

213
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,492
Lose that momentum and you're finished.
只要亂了節奏就完蛋了

214
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,036
The answer to #24? I don't care.
我不在意24題的正確答案是什麼

215
00:16:55,056 --> 00:17:00,833
Slashing through the exam, dominating it!
你如何掌握整場考試的節奏

216
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,435
That's all I care about.
我在意的是這個

217
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:08,103
What you need is vigor.
臨場作戰，靠的是氣勢

218
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,818
Vigor.
氣勢

219
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,438
Understand?
知道了嗎？

220
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,359
So I'll pay you this time each month.
每個月付一次薪水

221
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:30,363
3 classes a week, 2 hours each, okay?
每週一三五，每次兩小時，好嗎？

222
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,572
As for the fee,
至於鐘點費…

223
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,535
I was going to pay Min's rate, then I added a bit for inflation.
本來想付和敏赫老師相同的薪水 考慮物價上漲，就調高時薪了

224
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,841
Thank you.
謝謝

225
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,581
How about a proper introduction?
現在正式介紹一下吧

226
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:46,128
Da-hye's tutor, we'll call him Kevin. Mr. Kevin!
他是多蕙的英文家教，凱文老師 是，凱文老師

227
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,840
If you feel like snacking during your lesson, just call me.
上課時如果餓了，請隨時告訴我

228
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,968
If you need anything, ask her.
需要什麼，請隨時跟她說

229
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,637
She knows this house better than I...
她比我更熟悉這個房子…

230
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:58,349
Da-song, stop it!
多頌，不要這樣！

231
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,017
I'm sorry, did he startle you?
真的很抱歉，嚇到了吧？

232
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:04,564
How cute. His name's Da-song? Yes, our youngest.
沒事 很可愛呢，他叫多頌嗎？ 對，是我們家老么

233
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,232
Da-song, come say hi!
多頌，快打招呼

234
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,788
This is Mr. Kevin!
凱文老師

235
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:19,495
This is an Indian arrow. I ordered it from the U.S. From last year he's been an Indian fanatic.
這是印地安人的箭 我特別從美國網站買的 他從去年開始變成印地安控

236
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,664
Indians?
印地安控？

237
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,500
He's got a fanboy personality?
他容易對某件事入迷嗎？

238
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:31,007
Well, he's eccentric and easily distracted, he can barely sit still!
他很無厘頭又散漫 一刻都靜不下來

239
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,259
So last year I enrolled him in Cub Scouts,
所以去年讓他加入幼童軍

240
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:38,556
hoping he'd learn moderation and focus. But look.
希望他能遵守規定，變得專注點 結果你看

241
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,112
He's even worse.
他變得更奇怪了

242
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:49,358
His scout leader is an Indian fanatic, maybe that's why.
幼童軍團長好像是印地安控 似乎是受他影響…

243
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,528
The American Indian is the very spirit of the Cub Scouts.
幼童軍精神源自美國的印地安人

244
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,654
It's a good thing.
這是好事

245
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,782
Were you a Cub Scout, Kevin?
凱文老師以前是童軍嗎？

246
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,077
Sure, I'm a Scout by nature.
對，我很有當童軍的天分

247
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:05,041
Da-song is an artist by nature. Look at this painting.
我們多頌也很有藝術天分，你看

248
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,336
It's so metaphorical. It's really strong.
他的畫很抽象，感覺很強烈呢

249
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,087
Strong, right?
對吧？很強烈吧

250
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,019
You've got an eye for this.
凱文老師果然感受得到

251
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,176
It's a chimpanzee, right?
這畫的是猩猩吧？

252
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,653
A self-portrait.
這是自畫像

253
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,278
Sure enough!
我就知道

254
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,020
The perspective of a young artist eludes understanding.
以大人的眼光無法理解…

255
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,689
Or perhaps it's Da-song's expressive genius...
多頌藝術表達的天賦

256
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:34,111
Anyway, we've been through so many art teachers.
可能就是因為這樣 我們換過很多美術老師

257
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:37,339
None of them lasts even a month.
沒人撐得過一個月

258
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:42,927
And Da-song is just so hard to control.
再加上多頌有點不受控制

259
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,332
- Just a moment, Madame. - Yes?
夫人　-是

260
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:50,211
Someone just came to mind.
我想到一個不錯的人選

261
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,254
What was her name?
她的名字是…

262
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,132
Jessica! Right, Jessica...
潔西卡！對了，潔西卡…

263
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:59,512
She was in the same art school as my cousin.
她是我堂哥美術系上的學妹

264
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,264
What was her Korean name?
她的韓文名字叫什麼呢？

265
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:07,395
Anyway, after studying applied arts at Illinois State University,
總之，她原本就讀 伊利諾州立大學應用美術系

266
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,438
she returned to Korea.
最近剛回到韓國

267
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,899
Illinois... tell me more.
伊利諾…然後呢？

268
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:18,656
Her teaching is unusual, but she knows how to handle kids.
聽說她上課方式很特別 很能掌控孩子的狀況

269
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,826
She's got a special reputation in her field.
在美術圈算是少見的

270
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:31,252
But even though her methods are unique, she can help kids get into good art schools. Now I'm really curious. What is she like?
不過她上課不只方式獨特 還能一路輔導孩子考上美術系 真的嗎？我很好奇 她是什麼樣的人呢？

271
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,129
Would you like to meet her?
您想見見她嗎？

272
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:38,233
Though I heard she's in high demand...
不過聽說她很難約…

273
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,691
Hold on.
等等

274
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:48,811
Jessica, only child, Illinois Chicago,
「潔西卡獨生女，伊利諾州芝加哥」

275
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:53,699
classmate Kim Jin-mo, he's your cousin.
「系上學長金振慕，他是你堂哥」

276
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:02,992
Look at how he painted the side dishes on the tablecloth
你看多頌用食物在桌巾上

277
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,578
in this mosaic arrangement.
畫了馬賽克

278
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,456
But within that too, there are repeating patterns.
不過其中還有重複的圖案

279
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,625
Gochujang is red, the rice... well, anyway,
辣椒醬是紅色，米粒是…總之

280
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:17,006
he has a Basquiat-esque sense, even at age 9!
散發著巴斯奇亞式風格 他不過才9歲而已！

281
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,883
How exciting.
真令人期待

282
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:24,138
I'm sure Miss Jessica must have already sensed this,
我相信這些潔西卡老師都觀察到了

283
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:28,851
so I'll leave you two, and go up for Da-hye's lesson.
兩位請慢聊，我去幫多蕙上課

284
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,478
Have a nice lesson, Jessica.
潔西卡老師，下次見

285
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:33,330
Yes, thank you for the introduction.
是，謝謝你的引薦

286
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:43,749
So as you can see, Da-song's eccentric genius...
那邊可以看到多頌異於常人的才華

287
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,035
Da-hye.
多蕙

288
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:50,093
So we'll start with #38?
我們要從38題開始吧？

289
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,044
Kevin.
那個，老師…

290
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,378
Yeah?
嗯？

291
00:21:56,398 --> 00:22:01,759
Did you know that Da-song is faking it all?
你知道嗎？多頌全都是裝的

00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:04,386
Huh? What do you mean?

00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,263
It's all a show.
全都是作秀

294
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:10,100
Acting like a genius, that 4th dimension stuff is all fake.

多頌嗎？

297

You know that thing,

298
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:21,237
when he freezes and stares at the sky, as if struck by inspiration.
走在路上突然站住 看著天空假裝有靈感浮現

所以他走路會突然盯著天空10分鐘？

300
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,370
So you know what I mean?
你懂我的意思吧？

301
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,039
He gives me the creeps.
真是雞皮疙瘩掉滿地

302
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,668
He pretends that he can't live a normal life.

Makes me want to puke.
看到我都想吐了

304
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:41,131
So Da-song is pretending...

305
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:46,895
But what's that got to do with your studies?

Well, I'm just saying.

Sure, so in that sense,

what you told me about Da-song was very interesting,
你剛剛把多頌形容得挺有趣的

309
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,447
so let's write about it in English.
我們拿來練習英文寫作好了

310
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:11,954
And be sure to use the word 'pretend' at least twice.
不過「假裝」這個單字要用兩次以上

311
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:15,082
Then, can I ask you a question?
老師，那我可以問一個問題嗎？

312

She's your girlfriend, right?

No way... I just met her today.

then you are...

before I decide whether to take on Da-song,

But this is hard for me to talk about right now.

What to do? Never mind, then.
怎麼辦呢？ 沒關係

369
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:48,480
The lower-right region of a painting is called the 'schizophrenia zone'. Psychotic symptoms often reveal themselves here. Oh, phrenia... Look here.
通常畫的右下方稱為「思覺失調症區」 很常表現出精神方面的症狀 思覺失調… 請看這裡

Calm down. Let's compose ourselves.

This is all a black box into Da-song's mind.

我想打開，老師 那就需要每週一二四五 每次上課兩小時

Are you okay with that? It's my pleasure.

難道這傢伙不去開房間是為了省錢？

437
00:32:50,385 --> 00:33:05,380
He must be a pervert. He likes it in the car. Oh, that's gross. In his boss' car! A young guy's sex life is his own business, that's all fine.
可能是變態吧 比起摩鐵更喜歡在車上 髒死了，怎麼可以在老闆車子裡 年輕人私下有性生活不是問題

438
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,017
But why in my car?
為什麼偏偏在我的車子裡

439
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:14,848
And if so, why not in his seat? Why cross the line like that? You're right.
要做在自己的前座就好 為什麼要逾越界線？ 就是啊

440
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:23,200
Does dripping his sperm on my seat turn him on? I can't believe this.
非得把精液滴在我的位置才爽嗎？ 就是說啊

441
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:29,696
But you know what's strangest of all?
你知道最詭異的是什麼嗎？

442
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,923
What?
什麼？

443
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,493
Usually if you have car sex,
通常車震時

444
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:39,748
you might leave behind a strand of hair, or an earring.
應該會掉頭髮或耳環什麼的

445
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:40,999
Right.
沒錯

446
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:45,086
But how can you forget your own panties?
但怎麼會掉內褲呢？

447
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:50,258
That's right. It's hard to overlook.
就是啊，怎麼想都不可能

448
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:55,347
So it makes me quite suspicious of this woman's condition.
所以我懷疑那個女人的狀態

449
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,858
You get me?
你懂我的意思嗎？

450
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,903
Oh my... meth or cocaine? Shh! The kids...
天啊！冰毒、古柯鹼 噓！孩子會聽到

451
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,655
What do we do?
那怎麼辦？

452
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:14,491
What if anyone finds white powder in your car?
萬一車子裡查出白色粉末就糟糕了

453
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:17,410
Calm down, relax.
老婆，冷靜一點

454
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,371
Relax
放輕鬆

455
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:23,208
For now it's just supposition. A rational guess.
剛剛只是推測，合理懷疑而已

456
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:27,546
But no need to call the police. Not that!
沒有必要報警 那當然

457
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:34,636
Still, for a busy man like me to ask, "Why are you fucking in my car?" Exactly.
更何況我這個大忙人質問他 「你幹嘛在我車裡打炮？」也很可笑 確實很可笑

458
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:36,555
So instead...
所以說…

459
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:43,103
Can you just invent some bland excuse to let him go? Okay sure.
你找個藉口，低調地解雇他好嗎？ 好，知道了

460
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:46,606
No need to mention panties or car sex.
不要提到內褲或車震的事

461
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,692
We don't need to stoop to that level, do we?
我們沒必要降低格調，不是嗎？

462
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:51,027
Surely not!
就是啊

463
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:54,281
But what if he goes online and accuses us...
不過他會不會上網投訴我們…

464
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:56,658
Just give him a good severance.
你就多付一點資遣費

465
00:34:56,678 --> 00:35:00,120
How was Da-song today?
結束了嗎？今天多頌乖嗎？

466
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,497
He was fine.
是，還不錯

467
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:07,669
- So class is finished? - Yes. Jessica, the last time you came,
上完課了嗎？　-對 老師，上次你來上課

468
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:10,171
our driver gave you a ride, right?
尹司機送你回去那天

469
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,508
That's right. This may be an odd question,
是 這麼問有點怪

470
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,552
but nothing happened then?
但那天沒發生什麼事吧？

471
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,095
No, he was very nice.
沒事，他非常親切

472
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,972
I told him to go to Hyehwa Station,
我說到惠化地鐵站就好

473
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:22,350
but he insisted on driving me home.
但他堅持想送我回家

474
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,520
That jerk! He took you home late at night?
那傢伙這麼晚竟然想去你家？

475
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,064
Revealing where you live?
所以他知道老師家住哪？

476
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,650
No, I got off at Hyehwa.
沒有，我在惠化站下車了

477
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,153
Oh, good girl. Very good.
好險，太好了

478
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,696
Jessica nice...
潔西卡很棒

479
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,324
Did something happen with him?
他怎麼了嗎？

480
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:42,537
He won't be working for us anymore. A slightly shameful incident.
總之，發生不太好的事被解雇了

481
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:48,835
What incident? Oh, you don't need to know.
什麼事？ 老師不用知道這些

482
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:52,797
But I'm surprised. He was so gentlemanly and cool.
好意外，他看起來很紳士也很酷

483
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:56,259
Jessica, you're too young and innocent!
潔西卡，你太年輕單純了

484
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,012
You have a lot to learn about people.
你見過的人太少了

485
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:07,312
But we were excited to have such a young, hip driver, too. But isn't an older driver better?
雖然我們本來也覺得年輕司機不錯 司機還是年長一點比較好吧？

486
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:11,441
That's true. They drive better, have better manners.
的確是，開車技術好也更穩重

487
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:14,152
My father's brother had a driver just like that.
在我大伯家工作的司機就是那樣

488
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:21,951
Mr. Kim. He was so congenial and nice, I used to call him Uncle when I was young.
他叫金司機，人很溫柔穩重 我小時候都叫他叔叔

489
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:26,998
You know a man like that? Yes, he was so mild-mannered.
你認識那樣的人嗎？ 對，個性真的很好

490
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:32,754
Oh, but my relatives relocated to Chicago.
不過我大伯最近調到芝加哥

491
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:35,548
I wonder if Mr. Kim's free now?
金司機好像沒工作了

492
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:39,177
I'm really interested! Could I meet him?

493
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,762
Really?
真的嗎？

494
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:43,181
I don't trust anyone now.
我現在不太相信別人

495
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,309
I only trust someone recommended by a person I know well.
不是熟人推薦，我無法信任

496
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:53,566
But if you've known him so long, I'd feel much more at ease.
潔西卡老師從小認識的人 聽起來就很放心 到家了…

497
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,027
Do you really want to meet him?
真的要見他嗎？

498
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,946
I'm deadly serious.
我非常認真

499
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:01,950
This chain of recommendations is best.
我覺得透過信任的人介紹最好

500
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,660
How should I describe it?
就像是什麼呢？

501
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,286
A belt of trust?
信任鎖鏈

502
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:09,082
- This one's different. - Here. Oh, right. And this one.
不是這個，是這個 沒錯 還有這裡

503
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:10,750
Looks like a touch screen now.
這個好像是觸控的？

504
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:16,131
It's not touch, it says you have to turn it. Wow, this thing?
不是觸控，要用轉的才行 這真是的…

505
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:17,257
Sir?
先生

506
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:20,360
Taking our time, are we?
您在裡面的時間有點久呢

507

This is a nice car.

00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:30,236
This is it! Come over here.
在這裡，過來

Have a seat and wait here.
請你坐在這裡等他

511
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,468
Hello, nice to meet...
您好，初次見面

512
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,297
But is it compatible with a phone?
這個和手機相容嗎？

513
00:37:57,317 --> 00:38:05,054
Oh, not with a phone. You need more computing power.
不行，因為需要更高階的運算能力

514
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:10,310
This isn't any sort of test, so don't be nervous.
這不算試乘，你不用那麼緊張

515
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,938
I was worn out at the office, so I came out for a bit.
一整天工作太悶了想透透氣

516
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,315
I understand.
是，我了解

517
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:21,830
Constant chatter, all that bother. At least the car is peaceful.
整天面對人一定很累吧？ 至少在車子裡，請享受寧靜

518
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,282
Thank you.
謝謝

519
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,867
You seem to know the roads well?
你似乎對路很熟

520
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:29,287
Anything below the 38th parallel.
38度線以南的大街小巷都沒問題

521
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,832
After 30 years behind the wheel, the car almost drives itself.
畢竟我也開了30年的車

522
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,960
I respect those who work in one field for a long time.
我很尊敬長年在同個領域工作的人

523
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,755
Well, to be honest, this is a simple vocation.
其實這個職業很單純

524
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:42,175
But... the head of a household,
我載著一家之主

525
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:49,808
the leader of a company? Or else just a lonely man setting off on the road each morning...
一個公司老闆 或只是一個孤獨的男人 我每天早上和這個人一起上路

526
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:52,185
It's companionship of a sort,
就像某種陪伴

527
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:55,146
so that's how I've approached each day.
我以這樣的心情度過每一天

528
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,374
The years sure pass quickly.
時間過得真快呢

529
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:04,239
Sure enough, your cornering is excellent.
你的轉彎技術果然很純熟

530
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:10,537
Well, it may look simple, but it's one of the fundamentals.
看起來簡單，卻是基本功

531
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:15,500
She may look like a sheep, but inside, she's a fox.
她看起來很隨和，其實是老狐狸

532
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,003
Sometimes she acts like she owns the house.
有時候還把這房子當自己家

533
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:24,676
Right. Of all the people in that house, she's lived there the longest.
沒錯 在所有人當中，她住在那裡最久

534
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:28,388
She was housekeeper to the architect Namgoong,
她是前屋主南宮賢子老師的幫傭

535
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:33,142
but then she went on to work for this family.
接著繼續做多蕙家的幫傭

536
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,019
When the architect moved out,
南宮賢子老師搬家時

537
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:44,863
he introduced this woman to Park's family, telling them, "This is a great housekeeper, you should hire her." So she survived a change of ownership.
把她介紹給朴社長夫婦 還說「她真的持家有方，請聘用她」 屋主換了，幫傭卻沒換

538
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:48,116
She won't give up a good job easily.
她死守著這份好工作

539
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:52,996
To extract a woman like that, we need to prepare well.
想除掉那種女人，我們要有所準備

540
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:56,599
Right, we need a plan.

541
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:00,587
I want to eat peaches. I like peaches best.
我想吃水蜜桃，最喜歡水蜜桃了

542
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:02,088
Why not ask for some?
怎麼不叫阿姨準備？

543
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:07,601
No peaches at our house. It's forbidden fruit.
我們家不能吃水蜜桃，那是禁忌

544
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,519
So according to what Da-hye told me,
所以，根據多蕙的說法

545
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:21,107
she's got a massively serious allergy to peaches.
阿姨對水蜜桃嚴重過敏

546
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:24,485
You know that fuzz on a peach's skin?
你們知道水蜜桃外表都是毛吧？

547
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:36,045
If she's anywhere near it, she gets a full body rash, has trouble breathing, asthma, a total meltdown!
只要一靠近，全身就會起紅疹 出現呼吸困難、氣喘等嚴重症狀

548
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:42,420
No no, there weren't any peaches anywhere.
不是，家裡沒有水蜜桃

549
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,048
That's what I'm saying!
對，就是呀

550
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:47,884
Usually when I get symptoms like this,

551
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:51,179
I run to my room and take my medicine,
我就會立刻回房吃藥

552
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:56,809
but it was so sudden, I wasn't sure where I left it.

553
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:01,856
Madame, this woman behind me, is that...?
太太，請問後面這一位…

554
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:06,611
Oh, it's our housekeeper! So it's true. Oh, how sad.
是我們家的阿姨 真的是她，怎麼辦呢？

555
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:09,697
I wasn't sure if that was really her.
我原本不太確定是不是她

556
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:13,993
I've only seen her a couple times in the living room.
我在客廳見過一兩次而已

557
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:20,333
This was in the hospital? A few days ago I went for my annual medical exam.
這在醫院拍的嗎？ 我前幾天去醫院做健康檢查

558
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:24,963
I took a selfie for my wife, and there she was behind me.
我自拍要傳照片給我老婆 沒想到拍到她在我後面

559
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:32,387
Is she talking on the phone there? Anyway. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop... I wasn't trying to eavesdrop,
她正在講電話嗎？ 我不是故意聽她講電話的… 不是故意聽她講電話的

560
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,305
but her words came through clearly!
可是因為聽到一些內容

561
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,182
- So I couldn't help but...! - Cut, cut!
不自覺就聽下去…　-卡

562
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:41,771
Dad, your emotions are up to here. Bring them down to about there.
爸爸，你的情緒太高漲了 把它降到這裡好嗎？

563
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:44,565
...so I couldn't help but overhear.
不自覺…就聽下去了

564
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:47,872
Keep it focused!
用意有所指的方式

565
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:55,618
What I'm trying to say is, it's just that, your housekeeper's voice is quite loud, you know?
再次強調我不是故意偷聽 阿姨的嗓門真的很大

566
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:59,205
I understand, it's all right. Just tell me, okay?
沒關係，你說說看

567
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,166
She said she got diagnosed with active TB,
她說她罹患開放性肺結核

568
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,210
and she was shouting on the phone,
對著電話裡的人一直吼

569
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:09,841
so upset she could barely control herself! Tuberculosis? Come on...
氣到整個人有點失控 肺結核？不會吧…

570
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:15,471
It's true, she phoned someone saying she had active TB.
我親耳聽到她說得了肺結核

571
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:20,560
Do people still get TB?

572
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,686
Dad...

But I'm really hungry.

他是我老公吳勤世，打個招呼 真好吃，不過你的臉怎麼了？

877
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:27,083
I'll tell you later. So you'd steal food every day while working in the kitchen. Feeding your husband. Not at all! I bought all his food with my salary. That's so unfair!
那個待會兒再聊，吃根香蕉 所以你在廚房工作時，偷拿東西 來養你老公？ 才不是，他吃的全都是我用薪水買的 真是冤枉…

But how long has your husband been down here?

885
01:08:56,215 --> 01:09:15,173
in case North Korea attacks, or if creditors break in. But it seems Mr. Namgoong was a bit embarrassed about this, because he never mentioned it to Mr. Park's family. So only I know about it. So that's how it happened.
或是討債人上門時躲藏的地方 不過南宮賢子老師 似乎對這項設計感到羞恥 並沒有告訴他們這個地下室的存在 所以這裡只有我知道 原來如此

01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:47,288

像這樣躲了4年，討債的還不放棄 還在到處找他，威脅說要砍死他 你借高利貸嗎？

爸爸，我的腳踝！ 還好嗎？對不起 爸，我的腳 你怎麼可以叫我爸爸

這裡訊號好得很　-靠 阿姨，其實我們… 是這裡的工作太… 閉嘴，我不想聽，我豁出去了 大家一起去警局坐牢好了 我和你們拚個你死我活！ 阿姨，你瘋了嗎？

But she's particularly into this party.

01:47:48,921 --> 01:47:52,629
Well, you love her, after all.

01:47:57,221 --> 01:47:59,553
Mr. Kim.

You're getting paid extra.

01:48:08,023 --> 01:48:14,017
Think of this as part of your work, okay?
你就當作是工作好嗎？

1284
01:48:23,706 --> 01:48:25,354
Did you go down below?
媽下去過了嗎？

1285
01:48:25,374 --> 01:48:29,233
- Not yet. - Shouldn't we talk to them?
還沒，不過… 應該跟他們談談吧？

1286
01:48:29,253 --> 01:48:31,068
Reach an understanding?
找到對彼此都有利的方式

1287
01:48:31,088 --> 01:48:39,326
Exactly! We all got too fucking worked up last night. Dad was going on about some plan...
沒錯 昨天大家都太激動了 就是啊，不過爸爸說有計畫…

1288
01:48:39,346 --> 01:48:48,669
- I'm just going down there. - Hold on. Take this down to them. - They must be hungry. - Right. Let them eat first.
我先下去看看好了　-等等 把我準備好的食物拿下去 他們一定餓了　-沒錯 先讓他們吃點東西

What is it?
什麼事？

1294
01:49:00,534 --> 01:49:02,891
This is... how to describe it?
該怎麼解釋呢…

1295
01:49:02,911 --> 01:49:04,935
Da-song's trauma recovery cake?
這是讓多頌克服創傷的蛋糕

1296
01:49:04,955 --> 01:49:10,073
So it needs to be you who does it. Today's highlight!

01:53:11,868 --> 01:53:13,850
Stop!
不准動！

1305

The emergency room! Get the car!

Mr. Kim! What are you doing?

Makes it hurt more.

Don't touch it!

Hello, Mr. Park.
朴社長，您好

1319
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:34,431
You know me?
你認識我？

1320
01:54:34,451 --> 01:54:36,783
Respect!
我尊敬你

1321
01:56:02,747 --> 01:56:08,066
Opening my eyes for the first time in a month, I saw a detective.
一個月後睜開眼睛 第一個映入眼簾的是刑警

1322
01:56:08,086 --> 01:56:19,083
You have the right to an attorney... Who looked nothing like a detective.
你有選任律師的權利… 一個長得完全不像刑警的傢伙

1323
01:56:19,556 --> 01:56:21,621
Is he laughing?
他在笑嗎？

1324
01:56:21,641 --> 01:56:23,665
Just a sec.
請等一下

1325
01:56:23,685 --> 01:56:29,504
Then the doctor who looked nothing like a doctor spoke.
然後完全不像醫生的醫生也說話了

1326
01:56:29,524 --> 01:56:33,425
That happens sometimes after brain surgery.
腦部手術後有可能發生這種狀況

1327
01:56:33,445 --> 01:56:36,219
They keep laughing. For no reason.
會沒來由地一直笑

1328
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:38,722
Do you hear me?
你有聽到我說話嗎？

1329
01:56:38,742 --> 01:56:40,724
Can you hear me?
聽得到嗎？

1330
01:56:40,744 --> 01:56:42,601
Then do I have to do it again?
那我要重說一遍嗎？

1331
01:56:42,621 --> 01:56:47,074
Do what? The Miranda thing.
說什麼？ 米蘭達警告

1332
01:56:47,334 --> 01:56:59,743
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you... He keeps laughing, look!
你有權保持緘默 你可以選任律師… 你看，他一直笑

1333
01:56:59,763 --> 01:57:07,600
Even when I heard how much Ki-jung bled that day...
聽到那天基婷流了很多血

1334
01:57:08,021 --> 01:57:22,849
Even when I heard the words forgery, trespassing, foul play, self-defense and we were lucky to get away with a probation...
聽到大家說我偽造文書、侵入民宅 蓄意殺人但算是正當防衛 運氣很好被判緩刑宣告時

1335
01:57:22,869 --> 01:57:30,440
Even when I finally got to see Ki-jung's face... Kim Ki-jung, RIP
甚至終於見到基婷時 （金基婷）

1336
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:33,577
I kept laughing.
我一直都笑著

1337
01:57:42,556 --> 01:57:48,124
Still, when I went back and watched the news reports,
不過，當我看過去的新聞報導

1338
01:57:48,144 --> 01:58:05,183
I didn't laugh. This sudden rampage in the back yard of an upper-class home is a highly unusual case. Since the homeless man who sparked the rampage died at the scene, police are struggling to even establish a clear motive.
我沒有笑 高級住宅區發生隨機殺人事件 非常罕見 尤其揮刀的流浪漢當場死亡 警方很難掌握具體的行凶動機

1339
01:58:05,203 --> 01:58:09,813
The driver Kim and the slain Mr. Park are said to have been on good terms.
殺害朴姓男子的金姓司機平時個性溫和

1340
01:58:09,833 --> 01:58:15,694
For now the police investigation is focused on locating the driver Kim.
警方正全力通緝逃亡的金姓司機

1341
01:58:15,714 --> 01:58:19,781
Kim, after exiting this door and descending the stairs,
金姓司機從大門走下階梯後

1342
01:58:19,801 --> 01:58:23,702
disappeared into the neighboring alleys.
從住宅區的巷子消失了

1343
01:58:23,722 --> 01:58:29,165
Police searched the CCTVs of nearby homes to no avail,
警方在附近的監視器都找不到他的畫面

1344
01:58:29,185 --> 01:58:32,877
and they have yet to find any witnesses.
也完全找不到目擊者

1345
01:58:32,897 --> 01:58:35,213
Given the situation,
根據目前的情況

1346
01:58:35,233 --> 01:58:41,595
it's not an exaggeration to say that Kim vanished into thin air.
金姓司機可以說是徹底人間蒸發

1347
01:58:41,615 --> 01:58:50,579
Actually Mom and I had no idea where Dad was.
其實媽媽和我也不知道爸爸在哪

1348
01:58:50,915 --> 01:58:58,286
But those detectives still wore themselves out tailing us.
刑警卻大費功夫一直跟蹤我們

1349
01:59:00,425 --> 01:59:07,037
Eventually the news went quiet, and after the tails stopped,
等媒體不再大肆報導 刑警們也放棄跟蹤後

1350
01:59:07,057 --> 01:59:11,221
I started going up that mountain.
我偶爾會爬到那座山上

1351
01:59:12,479 --> 01:59:18,940
From up there, you get a great view of the house.
在山上可以清楚看到那間房子

1352
01:59:19,986 --> 01:59:24,554
That day, despite the cold,
那天特別冷，可是不知為何

1353
01:59:24,574 --> 01:59:28,112
I felt like staying longer.
我卻想繼續看著那裡

1354
01:59:40,215 --> 01:59:44,253
Dash-dash-dot-dot
劃、點、劃、劃、點、點…

1355
02:00:09,035 --> 02:00:11,321
Son!
兒子

1356
02:00:12,414 --> 02:00:14,655
Son!
兒子

1357
02:00:15,917 --> 02:00:21,331
Perhaps you, if no one else, will be able to read this letter.
如果是你，我想應該能讀到這封信

1358
02:00:23,007 --> 02:00:32,052
You were a Boy Scout, so I'm writing this just in case.
你是童軍出身，所以我用這種方式寫信

1359
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:36,183
Have your injuries healed?
身體恢復的情況還好嗎？

1360
02:00:36,438 --> 02:00:42,523
I'm sure your mom is plenty healthy.
我猜你媽健康的不得了

1361
02:00:44,654 --> 02:00:48,317
I'm doing fine in here.
我在這裡也很好

1362
02:00:48,533 --> 02:00:53,116
Though thinking of Ki-jung makes me cry.
雖然想到基婷就想哭

1363
02:00:54,581 --> 02:01:00,442
Even now, what happened that day doesn't seem real.
到現在我仍覺得那天很不可思議

1364
02:01:00,462 --> 02:01:03,499
It feels like a dream,
好像在做夢…

1365
02:01:03,798 --> 02:01:06,380
and yet it doesn't.
卻又不是

1366
02:01:06,885 --> 02:01:12,579
That day as I went out the gate, I suddenly knew.
那天我離開時，突然領悟到了

1367
02:01:12,599 --> 02:01:15,386
Where I needed to go...
我該去哪裡

1368
02:01:54,015 --> 02:01:57,123
A house where such a grisly crime took place
發生過凶殺案的房子

1369
02:01:57,143 --> 02:02:01,931
would surely not be easy to sell.
應該不太容易被賣掉

1370
02:02:03,483 --> 02:02:06,007
I'm sorry, Mr. Park.
朴社長，對不起

1371
02:02:06,027 --> 02:02:14,115
I struggled to hold out like that in an empty house.
新屋主搬來前，我苦撐了一段時間

1372
02:02:15,036 --> 02:02:18,102
Still, thanks to the house being empty,
不過幸好房子沒人住

1373
02:02:18,122 --> 02:02:23,107
what was her name? Moon-gwang?
那位叫什麼？雯光？

1374
02:02:23,127 --> 02:02:28,488
I was able to give her a proper send off.
我可以好好地替她送終

1375
02:02:28,508 --> 02:02:36,721
I hear tree-side burials are trendy, so hell, I did my best.
我替她辦了時下最流行的樹葬 我仁至義盡了

1376
02:02:38,476 --> 02:02:44,015
But those real estate sharks sure are clever.
不過賣房子的傢伙果然很聰明

1377
02:02:46,651 --> 02:02:51,177
They hoodwinked some people who hadjust arrived in Korea
竟然誘騙剛來韓國的人

1378
02:02:51,197 --> 02:02:54,405
and managed to sell the house.

1379
02:02:54,617 --> 02:02:57,934
With the parents working, and the kids attending school,

1380
02:02:57,954 --> 02:03:00,687
the family is usually out.

1381
02:03:00,707 --> 02:03:06,276

但因為有該死的幫傭24小時在家

1382
02:03:06,296 --> 02:03:12,916
Each time I go upstairs, I take my life in my hands.
害我半夜都要冒著生命危險去廚房

1383
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:18,454
It turns out Germans eat more than just sausage and beer.
原來德國人不只吃香腸、喝啤酒

1384
02:03:18,474 --> 02:03:21,340
What a relief.
真是萬幸啊

02:03:23,229 --> 02:03:29,064
Passing the time down here, everything starts to go hazy.
在這裡一切都變得好模糊

1386
02:03:31,863 --> 02:03:37,849
Today at least I was able to write you a letter.
今天至少能寫封信給你

1387
02:03:37,869 --> 02:03:41,936
If I send out the letter this way every night,

You're home, Ki-woo? Yeah.

but first I'll earn money.

You'll see once you go in, but it's very spacious.

Actually, we don't show this house to just anyone.

When I have money, I'll buy that house.
等我有錢，要買下這間房子

1400

On the day we move in, Mom and I will be in the yard.
